# web-scraping-challenge

In this challenge I will apply Splinter, HTML and parsing with Beautiful Soup to complete a two-part web-scraping analysis of the Mars News website.

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Extracting text elements:

Number of Terrestrial (Earth) Days in a Martian Year

<img width="767" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-10 at 7 22 19 PM" src="https://github.com/anastasiaskr2000/web-scraping-challenge/assets/131491720/a141c0f1-a5e2-4e36-810c-0751dbe5346c">

On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!
Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.
The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
